# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - I am proud of my ability to problem solve and trouble shoot code. I am also proud of my ability to google, find, learn, and play with new methods. This meaning that I tried using methods in capacities that I either knew worked, didn't work, or didn't know if they worked. I think that taking a method playing around with it and causing error messages and learning from that is important.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    - Methods are powerful tools for us to call upon to iterate through objects. built-in methods are great tools that allow us to call upon them multiple times. This saves us the burden of creating them on our own. On the other side of the coin, creating our own methods allows us the flexibility in code to create personal methods calling on various data types.
